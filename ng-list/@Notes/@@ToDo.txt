** Look at Telerik Demo site - add 1 or couple of things similar to what they show off.
** Add Form to show I know how to do that.
** Add Grid - maybe ag-grid...
** Build up Chat program/tab.
** Hit a true Restful service (since Firebase is actually running on Sockets).
** Use more Observable commands.



___Install___
* https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap   // Is this the most popular Bootstrap for ng2/4?  And s/ I use npm or bower to install it??
>> https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/tree/master/demo/src/app/components   // The ng version seems to have stuff I may want/need.



Yarn = s/ we use this instead of NPM?
