Bootstrap:

    Going to use this one. Very popular.  "This module plays nice with Bootstrap CSS v3 and v4".

    Too new - not ready for what I need. And its 1/2 as popular as ng2-bootstrap.
        Currently v1.0.0-alpha.20 - on Bootstrap 4 Alpha (made by the Angular Team itself):

___Install___
* https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap   // Is this the most popular Bootstrap for ng2/4?  And s/ I use npm or bower to install it??
>> https://github.com/ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap/tree/master/demo/src/app/components   // The ng version seems to have stuff I may want/need.
