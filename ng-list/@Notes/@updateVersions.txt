To update Angular:
- Rename ng-list folder.
- Commit everything to github.
- Restart c9 - otherwise updates to files will "magically" reappear (annoyingly).


https://www.npmjs.com/package/angularfire2
> npm install firebase angularfire2 --save
>> Just remove the old versions from package.json.
>> Move the newly added items to the top of package.json - so its easier to see what I've changed in it.
